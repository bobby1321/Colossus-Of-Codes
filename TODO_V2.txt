Things to do in V2:
	- Try to reduce dead area on board (talking about you top left corner)
	- Bigger resistors on LEDs (they are too bright)
	- Silkscreen things
	- Maybe design the case before / at the same time as the board so holes don't end up under keys :)
	- Also just put more holes in general
	- Try to put the chips on the front?
	- Maybe get chips with pull-down inputs, or just add pull-down resistors since I already have extra chips...
	- MEGA GAM3R RGB (per key, or just backlight?)
	- Thermal relief thingys? Make them better so that it doens't suck soldering to the ground plane.
