# Colossus of Codes QMK Keyboard
This keyboard is a custom QMK-enabled board with a few unique features:
- Left-hand numpad
- Extra row of remappable function keys (F13-F24 by default)
- Rotary Encoder (Volume control by default)
- IO Expander chips to allow for 121 keys with a single RP2040!

This design still needs some work (hence the V2 TODO list), but it is functional, and I've been using it as my daily driver for a few months now (as of Sept '24).
